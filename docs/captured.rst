Log capturing
=============

.. currentmodule:: logot

:mod:`logot` makes it easy to capture logs from the stdlib :mod:`logging` module:

.. code:: python

   with Logot().capturing() as logot:
      app.start()
      logot.wait_for(logged.info("App started"))

.. note::

   If using :mod:`pytest`, you can probably just use the pre-configured ``logot`` fixture included in the bundled
   :doc:`pytest plugin <pytest>` and skip manually configuring log capture. ðŸ’ª


Capturing :mod:`logging` logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :meth:`Logot.capturing` method defaults to capturing **all** records from the root logger. Customize this with the
``level`` and ``logger`` arguments to :meth:`Logot.capturing`:

.. code:: python

   with Logot().capturing(level=logging.WARNING, logger="app") as logot:
      app.start()
      logot.wait_for(logged.info("App started"))

For advanced use-cases, multiple :meth:`Logot.capturing` calls on the same :class:`Logot` instance are supported. Be
careful to avoid capturing duplicate logs with overlapping calls to :meth:`Logot.capturing`!

   See :class:`Logot` and :meth:`Logot.capturing` API reference.


.. _captured-3rd-party:

Capturing 3rd-party logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any 3rd-party logging library can be integrated with :mod:`logot` by sending :class:`Captured` logs to
:meth:`Logot.capture`:

.. code:: python

   def on_foo_log(logot: Logot, record: FooRecord) -> None:
      logot.capture(Captured(record.levelno, record.msg))

   foo_logger.add_handler(on_foo_log)

.. note::

   Using a context manager to set up and tear down log capture for every test run is *highly recommended*!
