Log-based testing ðŸªµ
====================

.. currentmodule:: logot

:mod:`logot` makes it easy to test whether your code is logging correctly:

.. code:: python

   from logot import Logot, logged

   def test_my_app(logot: Logot) -> None:
      app.start()
      logot.wait_for(logged.info("App started"))

.. note::

   These examples all show using :mod:`logot` with :mod:`pytest`. See :doc:`/using-unittest` to learn how to use
   :mod:`logot` with :mod:`unittest`.


Why test logging? ðŸ¤”
--------------------

Good logging ensures your code is debuggable at runtime, but why bother actually *testing* your logs? After all...
surely the worst that can happen is your logs are a bit *wonky*? ðŸ¥´

Sometimes, testing logs is the only *reasonable* way to known your code has actually run correctly! This is particularly
the case in *threaded* or *asynchronous* code where work is carried out at unpredictable times by background workers.

For example, imagine the following code running in a thread:

.. code:: python

   def poll_daemon(app: App) -> None:
      while not app.stopping:
         sleep(app.poll_interval)
         logger.debug("Poll started")
         try:
            app.data = app.get("http://is-everything-ok.com/")
         except HTTPError:
            logger.exception("Poll error")
         else:
            logger.debug("Poll finished")

.. note::

   It's certainly *possible* to rewrite this code in a way that can be tested without :mod:`logot`, but that often makes
   the code less clear or more verbose. For complex threaded or asynchronous code, this can quickly become burdensome.
   ðŸ‘Ž

Testing this code with :mod:`logot` is easy!

.. code:: python

   from logot import Logot, logged

   def test_poll_daemon(logot: Logot) -> None:
      app.start_poll()
      for _ in range(3):
         logot.wait_for(logged.info("Poll started"))
         logot.wait_for(logged.info("Poll finished"))


Testing threaded code
---------------------

Use :meth:`Logot.wait_for` to pause your test until the expected logs arrive or the timeout expires:

.. code:: python

   from logot import Logot, logged

   def test_my_app(logot: Logot) -> None:
      app.start()
      logot.wait_for(logged.info("App started"))

.. note::

   Use the ``timeout`` argument to :meth:`Logot.wait_for` to configure how long to wait before the test fails. This can
   be configured globally with the ``timeout`` argument to :class:`Logot`, defaulting to :attr:`Logot.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.

.. seealso::

   See :doc:`/log-pattern-matching` for examples of how to wait for logs that may arrive in an unpredictable order.


Testing asynchronous code
-------------------------

Use :meth:`Logot.await_for` to pause your test until the expected logs arrive or the timeout expires:

.. code:: python

   from logot import Logot, logged

   async def test_my_app(logot: Logot) -> None:
      app.start()
      await logot.await_for(logged.info("App started"))

.. note::

   Use the ``timeout`` argument to :meth:`Logot.await_for` to configure how long to wait before the test fails. This can
   be configured globally with the ``timeout`` argument to :class:`Logot`, defaulting to :attr:`Logot.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.

.. seealso::

   See :doc:`/log-pattern-matching` for examples of how to wait for logs that may arrive in an unpredictable order.


Testing synchronous code
------------------------

Use :meth:`Logot.assert_logged` to fail *immediately* if the expected logs have not arrived:

.. code:: python

   from logot import Logot, logged

   def test_my_app(logot: Logot) -> None:
      app.run()
      logot.assert_logged(logged.info("App started"))

.. note::

   You can also use :meth:`Logot.wait_for` to test for expected logs, but since this only fails after a ``timeout``,
   using :meth:`Logot.assert_logged` will give more immediate feedback if your test fails.

.. seealso::

   Use :meth:`Logot.assert_not_logged` to fail *immediately* if the expected logs *do* arrive.
