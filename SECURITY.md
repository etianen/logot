# Security policy

## Supported versions

As an open source project, only the latest major version of ``logot`` will be patched for security vulnerabilities.

Previous versions of `logot` are unlikely to be patched. ðŸ™‡


## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security](https://github.com/etianen/logot/security). Security issues will be fixed as soon as possible. ðŸ’ª

In the rare case that a security issue *cannot* be fixed, a mitigation will be published in the [project docs](https://logot.readthedocs.io).
